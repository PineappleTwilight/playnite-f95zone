# Playnite F95Zone Metadata Plugin (fork)

Since the original plugin is no longer being maintained, I decided to fork it.

## About
This Playnite plugin is used to fetch game metadata from F95Zone.

## How to install:
1. Download the latest release, it should be a .pext file
2. Drag the downloaded .pext file into your Playnite window
3. Click the "Yes" button
4. Steps 5+ are required for searching
5. Click on the Playnite logo in the top-left
6. Click on "Add-ons"
7. Click on Extension Settings > Metadata Sources > F95Zone
8. Click on the Login button and log in to your F95Zone account 
9. If you want to automatically check your games for updates, make sure to enable it!
10. Once complete, you can now click the Save button.

Now, whenever you add a game and click the "Download Metadata..." button, an F95Zone button should appear.

## Troubleshooting
### Why don't I get results when searching for games?
Answer: Try logging in again (steps 7-8)
