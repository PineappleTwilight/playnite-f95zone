# Playnite F95Zone Metadata Plugin (fork)

Since the original plugin fork is no longer being maintained, I decided to fork it.

**You MUST go into plugin settings and use the login button. I have removed manual cookie insertion due to various problems/inefficiency. You shouldn't need to manually input your cookies anyway.**

## About
This Playnite plugin is used to fetch game metadata from F95Zone.

## How to install:
1. Download the latest release, it should be a .pext file
2. Drag the downloaded .pext file into your Playnite window
3. Click the "Yes" button
4. Steps 5+ are required for searching
5. Click on the Playnite logo in the top-left
6. Click on "Add-ons"
7. Click on Extension Settings > Metadata Sources > F95Zone
8. Click on the Login button and log in to your F95Zone account 
9. If you want to automatically check your games for updates, make sure to enable it!
10. Once complete, you can now click the Save button.

Now, whenever you add a game and click the "Download Metadata..." button, an F95Zone button should appear.

## Troubleshooting
### Why does it give me an error when I try to scrape data?
Answer: Try logging in again (steps 7-8)

### Why does it give me a "forbidden" error?
Answer: Use a VPN or wait a few hours. This is tied to IP address.
